# pytest-xspec specification

pytest-xspec connects declared requirements to collected pytest tests and answers:
**Have all declared requirements been verified by successfully executed pytest tests?**

This living specification defines supported behavior and acceptance criteria. The
[architectural principles](architecture_principles.md) define responsibility boundaries.
The [README](../README.md) owns public usage and runnable examples, and
[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns contributor setup and workflow.

## Supported runtime and naming

Python 3.10+ and pytest 8+ are supported. The distribution and repository are named
`pytest-xspec`, the import package is `pytest_xspec`, the `pytest11` entry point is
`xspec`, and the TOML configuration section is `[tool.xspec]`.
The installed plugin is discovered automatically and requires no runtime dependency beyond pytest.

## Requirement declarations

Requirement IDs are arbitrary, opaque strings, including dotted IDs, Unicode, spaces
and punctuation. Duplicate IDs and non-string IDs are rejected.

An explicit inventory can be declared in either configuration file:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.xspec]
requirements = ["REQ-001", "REQ-002"]
```

```ini
# pytest.ini
[pytest]
xspec =
    REQ-001
    REQ-002
```

When neither file declares an inventory, the plugin reads `xspec.toml` from pytest's
project root, regardless of the working directory:

```toml
[[requirements]]
id = "REQ-001"
description = "A short statement of the requirement."
rationale = "Why the requirement matters."

[[requirements]]
id = "REQ-002"
```

The document is an array of requirement tables. Each entry requires a string `id`.
Descriptions and rationales are optional strings and may be empty. Unknown fields
are ignored. Only IDs enter verification and reports. Equivalent TOML syntax,
including inline tables inside an array, is accepted.

### Source selection and validation

- Inventories declared in both configuration files produce an error naming both files.
  Sources are never merged. A configuration file without an inventory can coexist with
  an inventory in the other file.
- An explicit inventory takes precedence over `xspec.toml`, including an empty inventory.
  An unused document is neither opened nor validated. Invalid explicit configuration
  remains an error and does not trigger fallback.
- A configuration file without an inventory does not disable the document fallback.
- `requirements = []` declares zero requirements in `xspec.toml`. A selected document
  without `requirements`, including an empty file, is rejected. Invalid document syntax
  or contents produce a configuration error naming `xspec.toml` before tests run.
- With no inventory and no document, there are zero declared requirements.
- No inventory is read from `setup.cfg`, `tox.ini`, JSON, YAML or other files.
  Ordinary pytest may still use its own supported configuration files.

## Test associations

Each `@pytest.mark.xspec("REQ-001")` marker associates a test with one declared ID.
The plugin registers the marker, including for pytest's strict-marker validation.
Each marker requires exactly one positional string ID and no keyword arguments.
Unknown IDs and malformed markers are rejected even without a report option, with
zero declared requirements, and when filtering would exclude the collected test.

One requirement can have multiple tests. One test can support multiple requirements
through multiple markers, and appears under every associated requirement in results.
Repeated markers never count a test twice. Module and class markers apply to individual
tests, and each parameterized case retains its complete pytest node ID.

Associations are recorded before pytest deselection. Collected tests excluded by filters
retain their identities and receive `DESELECTED`. Tests outside the collected paths have
no invented identities or deselected records. A declared requirement without any associated
collected tests is `MISSING`, with an empty test list.

Full collection is required for authoritative verification coverage. Native `-k` and `-m`
filters retain known associations because they act after initial collection.

## Outcomes and requirement statuses

Setup, call and teardown reports produce one final outcome per test node ID.
Requirement statuses aggregate those test outcomes using this precedence, highest first:

`ERROR > FAILED > XPASSED > XFAILED > SKIPPED > DESELECTED > PASSED`

| Status | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| `ERROR` | An associated test encountered a setup or teardown error. |
| `FAILED` | An associated test failed. |
| `XPASSED` | An associated test unexpectedly passed, with strict or non-strict XFAIL. |
| `XFAILED` | An associated test failed as expected, including XFAIL raised by a fixture. |
| `SKIPPED` | An associated test was skipped or was collected but never executed. |
| `DESELECTED` | An associated collected test was excluded by filtering. |
| `PASSED` | Every associated test passed. |
| `MISSING` | No collected test references the requirement. |

`MISSING` applies only when there are no associated collected tests. Fixture skips are
`SKIPPED`. Expected failures raised during setup or teardown are `XFAILED`.
Assertion text containing `[XPASS(strict)]` does not turn an ordinary test failure into
an unexpected pass. Teardown errors take precedence over a passing or failing test call.

Collected tests that never execute retain their node IDs and receive `SKIPPED`, including
collect-only runs and tests left after an early stop. For example, one passed test and one
unexecuted test leave their shared requirement `SKIPPED`, even when an unmarked failure
caused the early stop.

## Verification verdict and coverage

A requirement is verified only when its status is `PASSED`. Unmarked test outcomes do
not contribute to requirement statuses. The overall verdict is true only when every
declared requirement is `PASSED` and there are no collection errors.

Coverage is `PASSED requirements / declared requirements × 100`. Zero declared
requirements produce zero passed, zero unverified and numeric coverage of 0.0%.
The verdict is successful in this case when there are no collection errors.

Collection errors prevent successful verification even at 100% requirement coverage.
They are counted separately because an uncollected test cannot always be associated
with a requirement.

The verdict is independent of pytest's ordinary exit status. A failing unmarked test
can fail the pytest command even when every requirement is verified.

## Command-line behavior

| Invocation | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `pytest` | Validate requirement configuration and markers without printing a requirement report. |
| `pytest --xspec-report` | Print requirement verification feedback. |
| `pytest --xspec-strict` | Print feedback and fail when the verification verdict is false. |
| `pytest --xspec-json=PATH` | Write structured verification results to the requested path. |
| `pytest --xspec-select=ID` | Select tests associated with the exact requirement ID. |
| `pytest -m xspec --xspec-strict` | Select requirement-marked tests and enforce verification. |

Strict mode evaluates the entire declared inventory, including requirements outside
the selected IDs. A false verdict changes pytest exit codes 0 (success) and 5 (no tests)
to 1 (test failure). Existing pytest failures and error exit codes remain intact.

### Requirement selection

Repeated `--xspec-select=ID` options select the union of exact IDs. Repeated IDs and
overlapping associations never execute a test twice. Commas, spaces and Unicode belong
to the ID, with no splitting or prefix matching. Unmarked tests are excluded.
Native collection paths, `-k` and `-m` intersect with requirement selection.

Unknown selected IDs produce a usage error (exit code 4) identifying the ID before
fixtures or tests execute, including a selection mixing known and unknown IDs.
Selecting declared requirements without matching tests produces an empty selection.
Without strict mode, an empty selection preserves pytest's no-tests exit code, 5.

Selection preserves all requirement associations and reports the full inventory.
Unselected requirements remain in the coverage denominator, including results shared
with selected requirements. Filtered tests follow the association and outcome rules above.

### Discovery

`--collect-only -q` lists the selected node IDs without running fixtures or test bodies.
The discovered selection matches execution under the same paths and filters, including
parameterized cases. Collected modules still import and need their normal dependencies.
Configuration and marker validation still apply, and collection errors prevent verification.
The outcome rules above keep discovered tests unverified.

## Structured results

JSON includes every declared requirement, its status, individual associated test node IDs
and outcomes, and the verification summary:

```json
{
  "requirements": {
    "REQ-001": {
      "status": "PASSED",
      "tests": [
        {"nodeid": "test_behavior.py::test_behavior", "outcome": "PASSED"}
      ]
    },
    "REQ-002": {"status": "MISSING", "tests": []}
  },
  "summary": {
    "requirements": 2,
    "passed": 1,
    "unverified": 1,
    "coverage": 50.0,
    "verified": false,
    "collection_errors": 0
  }
}
```

`summary.verified` contains the verification verdict defined above. Coverage is a numeric
percentage. Requirements retain inventory order, and test lists retain collection order.

### Selection scope

When requirement selection is active, JSON adds one top-level `scope` object:

```json
{
  "selected_requirements": ["REQ-002", "REQ-001"],
  "collection_paths": ["test_behavior.py"],
  "keyword_expression": "shared",
  "marker_expression": "xspec",
  "collect_only": false
}
```

Selected IDs retain first-occurrence order with duplicates removed. Collection paths are
pytest's effective collection arguments, including explicit node IDs, in their original
order. With no explicit paths, pytest uses configured `testpaths`, or `["."]` when none
are configured. Absent `-k` and `-m` expressions are empty strings, and `collect_only`
is a boolean. Without requirement selection, the `scope` key is absent.

## Terminal feedback

The terminal report shows requirement IDs, statuses and associated test counts in inventory
order, followed by total requirements, passed, unverified and coverage rounded to one
decimal place. It includes `Collection errors: 1` for a single collection error.

With colors enabled, the entire report is green for a successful verification verdict
and red otherwise, both in report and strict mode. This includes successful zero-requirement
verification and successful requirement verification with failing unmarked tests.
Pytest's color settings apply, including `--color=no`.

When requirement selection is active, terminal feedback adds the same scope as JSON:

```text
Selected requirements: ["REQ-002", "REQ-001"]
Collection paths: ["test_behavior.py"]
Keyword filter: shared
Marker filter: xspec
Discovery only: no
```

Arrays use JSON notation to preserve opaque IDs. Empty filter expressions display `(none)`,
and discovery displays `yes` or `no`. Without requirement selection, scope lines are absent.
Counts and coverage always describe the entire declared inventory.
